# Stencil: A Compiler for Web Components

Stencil is a simple compiler for generating Web Components.

The webpack plugin allows apps to easily import components using the webpack bundler. The plugin is for apps with build scripts already using a traditional webpack toolchain. However, webpack is not required to use web components built by Stencil since they are already lazy-load themselves on-demand, and use standardized ES Modules imports.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular front-end frameworks into a compile-time rather than a run-time tool. Stencil's output is just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.


## Import Components

First install the component library to be used, such as:

```
npm install @ionic/core
```

Next, import the component library within the app's entry file, such as:

```js
import `@ionic/core`;
```


### Updating `webpack.config.js`

Webpack will bundle the simple "registry" information of all the components into webpack's main bundle, but it does not include the actual component code. Instead the plugin copies external component assets to webpack's output directory, which allows for the web components to be lazy-loaded on-demand by the browser, and only pull down polyfills when required.

After installing the plugin, modify your `webpack.config.js` file as such:

```
npm install --save-dev @stencil/webpack
```

```js
const stencil = require('@stencil/webpack');

...

  "plugins": [
    new stencil.StencilPlugin()
  ]

```
